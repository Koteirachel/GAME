    <td>Workers right/Labor right are the rights of the working class. Anyone who has done labor of some sort for a job.  Some workers take, for example, the Amazon delivery drivers, have to experience the stress of having to deliver packages as fast as possible to the demand for deliveries being brought in 2 days or so. Which doesnâ€™t give them any time to take a break.
